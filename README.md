# Jelly
Jelly is a programming language that I've developed as a pet project.
If you would like, you can download it and create your own `.jelly` programs!

> Jelly runs on .NET Core 2.2, which is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

## Quick Start
1) Create a folder with as many `*.jelly` files as you like, these can be in any subdirectory needed for organisation.
2) Open the command line and navigate to the directory which Jelly was installed in. Assumning it was installed in the Users\USERNAME\ directory, on Windows: `cd C:\Users\USERNAME`.
3) Run the command `dotnet Jelly.dll "FOLDER_PATH_OF_JELLY_CODE"`.

Optionally, add the `-op` flag to optimise the code before running it.
